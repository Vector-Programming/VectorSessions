- Make a program to create and print an array with the following structure using numpy features `arange` and `reshape` : `[[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]]`
- Make a program to create and print a `(10x10)` 2D array, each row of which contains the first 10 multiples of the row number. IE: `[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20], [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]...]`
