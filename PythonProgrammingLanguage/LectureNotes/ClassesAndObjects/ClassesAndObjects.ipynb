    "* A **class**, in *object-oriented programing*, is a code template for creating objects. The template contains some basic characteristics/intial values and implementations of behaviour of an object.  \n",
    "### What are objects?\n",
    "* An **object** refers to a particular instance of a class, where the oject can be a combination of Variables, functions(methods) and data structures. Really an object is just a data type with Polymorphism and Inheritance (Wikipedia them) \n",
    "### What is object-oriented programming(OOP)?\n",
    "* OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which may contain contain data(characteristics) and code in the form of procedures(behaviours) known as methods.  \n",
